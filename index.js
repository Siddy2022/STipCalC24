const btnEl = document.getElementById("calculate"); 
//This line declares a constant variable btnEl and assigns it the reference to the HTML element with the id "calculate". This element is presumably a button.

const billInput = document.getElementById("bill");
//Similar to the first line, this declares a constant variable billInput and assigns it the reference to the HTML element with the id "bill". This element is likely an input field where the user can enter the bill amount.

const tipInput = document.getElementById("tip");
//Similarly, this line declares a constant variable tipInput and assigns it the reference to the HTML element with the id "tip". This is likely an input field where the user can enter the tip percentage.

const totalSpan = document.getElementById("total");
//Once again, this line declares a constant variable totalSpan and assigns it the reference to the HTML element with the id "total". This element is probably a span where the total amount will be displayed.

function calculateTotal() {
  const billValue = billInput.value;
  //billValue is assigned the value of the bill input field (billInput.value).
  
  const tipValue = tipInput.value;
  //tipValue is assigned the value of the tip input field (tipInput.value).
  
  const totalValue = billValue * (1 + tipValue / 100);
  //totalValue is calculated by multiplying the bill value by (1 + tipValue / 100), representing the total amount with the tip.
  
  totalSpan.innerText = totalValue.toFixed(2);
  //The innerText property of the totalSpan element is set to totalValue.toFixed(2), which converts totalValue to a string with two decimal places and sets it as the text content of the total span.
}

btnEl.addEventListener("click", calculateTotal);
//This line adds an event listener to the button (btnEl). It listens for a "click" event, and when the button is clicked, it calls the calculateTotal function. This means that when the button is clicked, it will execute the logic inside the calculateTotal function, updating the total amount based on the bill and tip values entered by the user.


//In summary, this code sets up an event listener for a button click, and when the button is clicked, it calculates the total amount including the tip based on the user-entered bill amount and tip percentage, then displays the result on the webpage.
